My name is Zachary Colimon I'm currently a freshman CoE at the university of Pittsburgh. In the past I've done mechanical engineering tasks and so I'm currently looking for internships that will take advantage of those skills. I have lots of CAD/CAM experience, primarily in fusion 360. THis year as a part of the Pitt rocketry payload team I've made the transition to solidworks.
