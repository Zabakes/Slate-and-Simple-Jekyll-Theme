This is a swerve module designed and programmed for FTC Team 8088 by me :)

<h1>CAD</h1>
<p>
The design of this swerve module was an off season project to help me hone my CAD/CAM abilities. I only got the chance to make one full module before the season started so I can't speak to how well the chassis as a whole would work but the individual module worked well so I'm confident the full chassis would also work well.
</p>

<h1>CODE</h1>
<p>
I The code for this swerve chassis is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/Zabakes">my github</a> under <a href="https://github.com/Zabakes/FTC_18_8088_TEST">FTC_18_8088_TEST</a> in the master branch. currently other mechanisms are implemented but all the code for swerve is there. The code creates a swerve module object for each swerve module and a swerve object for the chassis as a whole. The chassis inherits some methods from a mech class that take care of the things that every mechanism on any robot needs to. For more information read the JavaDoc.
