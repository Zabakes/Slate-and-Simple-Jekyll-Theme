I wrote this script to use dynamic keyboard layers on my MMO mouse. It's completely configurable so if you wanted to you could use it on a standard Numpad.

Using the script is complicated to explain but simple in practice. The idea behind the script is a dynamic keyboard layer based on the active application. This can be broken down into two parts. 
</p>
<p>
The first is the idea of a keyboard layer. "Layer refers to a set of additional key bindings achieved by holding down a modifier key on the keyboard." (deskthority). The most basic example of this is the shift key. Normally all the letters are mapped to their lowercase variants, but when the shift key is held the "uppercase layer" is activated and KEYS BECOME MAPPED TO UPPERCASE LETTERS. The mouse script works the same way, when the toggle key is held the keys to toggle (as specified in config) get mapped to a dynamic layer.

This layer is dynamic because it changes based on the active application. If you're using Chrome "6" might be mapped to change tabs on this layer. If you're using VSCode instead "6" might be mapped to the hotkey for selecting the current line. This is completely customizable using the configuration utility. In the example above you can see 6 mapped to camera controls in CAD then mapped to change tabs in firefox.

This lets you save lists of urls as .Tabs files then open them later with you default browser. For firefox the addon is in the addon store <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-tabs-urls-to-tabs-files/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search" target="_blank">Here</a>
