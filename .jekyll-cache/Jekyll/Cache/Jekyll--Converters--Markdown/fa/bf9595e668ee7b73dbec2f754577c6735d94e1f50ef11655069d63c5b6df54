Sol is FRC 333's 2019 robot. This robot won awards for both it's looks and it's functionality. It has a passive intake for hatch panels and a roller across it's front that feeds the main claw cargo. I was responsible for the CAD and CAM on this robot. I did a majority of the CAD/CAM myself but also managed 3 other members of the CAD/CAM team.

<h1>HATCH PANEL MECHANISM</h1>
<p>
The hatch panel mechanism was designed to slide and pivot any way it needed too in order to passively grab a hatch panel from the human player station. The mechanism has an embedded sensor that uses two  LED's and a photosensitive resistor to detect when it has hatch panels in it's possession. When it comes time to let the hatch panel go this mechanism uses a single-acting pneumatic cylinder to release and score the hatch panel. I did the design work for this mechanism and it's embedded sensor.
