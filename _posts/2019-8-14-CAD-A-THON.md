I designed the chassis and climber for this robot. The chassis is designed in the style of a tank with spring actuated pivots. This helps our robot handle the terrain on the hypothetical field. The climber latches onto a 2" pipe using a pneumatic cylinder the rappels into the mine shaft to score a ranking point. The descent of the robot is controlled by a passive breaking mechanism.
