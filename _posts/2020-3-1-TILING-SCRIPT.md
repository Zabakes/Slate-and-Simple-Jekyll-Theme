This tiling manager is pretty simple and intuitive. Windows get put into cells that are a fraction of each monitor. You can specify what cells to place the window into by clicking and dragging. The cells will be highlighted as in the GIF of me writing this page above. This is packaged with the toggle script and it's executable is in the same ZIP in the release. You can use it without the toggle script by simply running the executable. You can also right-click to resize multiple windows at a time.
