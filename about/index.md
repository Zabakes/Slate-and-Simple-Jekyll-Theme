<p>
My name is Zachary Colimon. I'm currently a junior CoE at the University of Pittsburgh. I'm also working as a hardware engineer at ZeroDK a startup trying to improve oral hygiene habits. This site is a collection of projects I've worked on. I normally update it whenever I'm looking for new internships/jobs.
